# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## 3.0.0 - RELEASE - 07-JAN-2021

- Using continue pagination and remove mechanism to iterate based in `next`
- Remove `continue` flag to support navigation to next page
- Remove `page` param to support navigation to a give page

## 2.4.1 - RELEASE - 05-NOV-2020

- Fixing bug deserializing Resource Maps with floats.
- Fixing bug deserializing URL query string when the value contains the character `=`.

## 2.4.0 - RELEASE - 24-SEP-2019

- Removing auth header when requests to the registry/services endpoint.

## 2.3.0 - RELEASE - 20-JUN-2019

- Update HttpClientAccessCredentialProvider to use registry in order to extract identity service location per owner to get tokens. To avoid making requests to registry continuously, a cache has also been implemented to store identity hosts per owner name. Values in the cache will expire after 10 minutes, so that, if any change is done in registry, it will be reflected in the client in 10 minutes as much.

## 2.2.0 - RELEASE - 16-MAY-2019

- Release minor version

## 2.1.6 - RELEASE - 16-MAY-2019

- Add `continue` flag to support navigation to next page

## 2.1.5 - RELEASE - 07-FEB-2019

- Upgrade google http client version. This fixes some bugs related to not being able to do a browse using a Map<String, String> with certain headers as `accept` or `content-type`

## 2.1.4 - RELEASE - 29-JAN-2019

- Headers `accept` and `content-type` with value `application/json` added to GET operations

## 2.1.3 - RELEASE - 28-NOV-2018

- Fix NPE when some of the linked resources in an array have the field `statusCode` and some others don't

## 2.1.2 - RELEASE - 15-OCT-2018

- New serializer for `MetadataType` to avoid building the jsonObject when it's empty. It is empty on these cases:

```
"metadata": {}
```

```
"metadata": {
  "fields": {}
}
```

```
"metadata": {
  "fields": {
    "locks": {},
    "locking": {}
  }
}
```

## 2.1.1 - RELEASE - 25-SEP-2018

- The headers are kept in the possible pagination requests

## 2.1.0 - RELEASE - 19-SEP-2018

- Added the option to pass headers parameter to the endpoint

## 2.0.0 - RELEASE - 23-MAY-2018

- Add capability to call services for owners different from the owner which the client was first instantiated.
 
  `client.service("myService", "myOwner")` will use registry service to look for a service named `myService` among all services for owner `myOwner`.

- Extend current functionality to add the owner query param to the url when creating the resourceful endpoint even if the user  does not add when calling the method. 

  `client.service("myService", "myOwner").resourcefulEndpoint("myService", MyClass.class)` 
  
  will generate a URL kind of: `http://myHost:ports/myPath/myService?owner=myOwner`

- RequestClient moved to interface, and added the capability to define at configuration which implementation to be used when creating the client. So this means that
  the implementation of Http requests can be now delegated to the user. Regarding the old implementation itÂ´s being hold in the distribution as the default RequestClient
  implementation, using Google Http libraries.

## 1.9.2 - RELEASE - 21-MAR-2018

- Add `@Key` annotation to `Resource#title` field 

## 1.9.1 - RELEASE - 09-MAR-2018

- Removed dependencies for:
    - WiremockHelper
    - Sequoia Annotation
- The client won't paginate by default to the next page if there isn't any content even though there are pagination links.

## 1.9.0 - RELEASE - 06-FEB-2018

- Resource [common fields](https://gitlab.piksel.com/sequoia-core/sequoia-lib-resourceful#common-fields) added to `Resource` class:
    - title
    - createdBy
    - deletedAt
    - deletedBy
    - metadata
    - reapAt
    - scores
- The field `metadata` is retrieved only when the resource is got directly using its reference, for instance:

```java
ResourceResponse<Content> content = endpoint.read(Reference.fromReference("owner:xxxxxxxxxxxx"));
```

Be careful if you have some classes using any of the above fields, that might cause issues. 

## 1.8.0 - RELEASE - 30-JAN-2018

- The exception `RequestExecutionException` has more details in the message: http verb and URL.
- New possibility of adding an HTTP Interceptor to the client so you can hook your actions to every response, such as logging. Check README file to get more information about how to use it. For more info see [PROCESSING-2464](https://pikselpalette.atlassian.net/browse/PROCESSING-2464)
-  When any exception other then HttpResponseException will occur while executeRequest process then RequestClient rise `RequestExecutionException` with this exception in cause parameter

## 1.7.0 - RELEASE - 08-JAN-2018

- Expose initializeRequest method in RequestClient so that it can be overriden from classes which are extending it, for more info see [PROCESSING-2392](https://pikselpalette.atlassian.net/browse/PROCESSING-2392)
- Credentials are optional instead of mandatory in ClientConfiguration to create SequoiaClient, this allows to call services which don't require authentication using SequoiaClient, for more info see [PROCESSING-2399](https://pikselpalette.atlassian.net/browse/PROCESSING-2399)

## 1.6.1 - RELEASE - 18-DEC-2017
